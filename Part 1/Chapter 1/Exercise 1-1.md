- Currently my goals are to learn the basics of HTML and CSS so I can get a feeling for web development and design. If need be, in the future I could further my knowledge and become "professional".
- At this point, I can't say with certainty since I haven't had the experience with web design.
- I have some coding experience with Python, C and most importantly - JavaScript. Also I've made some HTML pages for uni but not too serious.
- Probably everything to be honest xd.
- I've got everything, two PCs, monitors etc.
- Nothing.
